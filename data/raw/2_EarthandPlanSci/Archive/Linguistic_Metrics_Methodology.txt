# Linguistic Metrics Calculation Methodology

## Overview
This document details the methodology used to calculate linguistic metrics for academic abstracts in the OA_EPS_6392.csv file, following the structure defined in C_EPS_10298.csv and Spreadsheet_Guide.csv.

## Metrics Calculated (Columns R-AC)

### 1. Flesch Reading Ease (Column R)
- Formula: 206.835 - 1.015 * (words/sentences) - 84.6 * (syllables/words)
- Higher scores indicate easier readability (0-100 scale)

### 2. Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (Column S)
- Formula: 0.39 * (words/sentences) + 11.8 * (syllables/words) - 15.59
- Indicates U.S. school grade level needed to understand the text

### 3. Syllable Count (Column T)
- Total syllables in the abstract
- Uses CMU Pronouncing Dictionary with fallback estimation

### 4. Gunning Fog Index (Column U)
- Formula: 0.4 * ((words/sentences) + 100 * (complex_words/words))
- Complex words = words with 3+ syllables

### 5. Complex Word Count (Column V)
- Count of words with 3 or more syllables

### 6. SMOG Index (Column W)
- Formula: 1.0430 * sqrt(complex_words * (30/sentences)) + 3.1291
- Estimates years of education needed to understand text

### 7. Hedging Frequency (Column X)
- Count of hedging words (may, might, could, possibly, etc.)
- Full list includes ~50 common hedging terms

### 8. Hedging % (Column Y)
- (Hedging words / Total words) * 100

### 9. Passive Voice Ratio (Column Z)
- Passive constructions / Total sentences
- Detects patterns like "was/were + past participle"

### 10. Normalisation Rate (Column AA)
- Nominalizations / Total words
- Counts words ending in -tion, -ment, -ness, -ity

### 11. Lexical Density (Column AB)
- Content words / Total words
- Content words = nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs

### 12. Citation Density (Column AC)
- (Citations / Total words) * 100
- Detects patterns like (Author, Year) and [1]

## Implementation Details
- Used NLTK for tokenization and POS tagging
- CMU Pronouncing Dictionary for syllable counting
- Regular expressions for pattern matching
- All metrics rounded to specified decimal places per guide
